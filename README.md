# RScripts :bar_chart:

A collection of R scripts put together for your convenience.

## hardwareTesting :tv:
**Contains all of the scripts related to hardware testing and compute resource benchmarking.**
<dl>
<dt>codeRuntime.R</dt> 
<dd>An R script to measure the time taken to execute a loop. </dd>

<dt>memory.R</dt> 
<dd>An R script to measure and report the time taken to generate and store 1 billion random integers. </dd></dl>

## memoryHandling :newspaper:
**Contains all of the scripts related to memory management.**
<dl>
<dt>memoryUsage.R</dt>
<dd>An R script that measures memory usage on a system running R. Variables occupy the total available memory. This is great to use when demonstrating R's garbage collection.</dd>
</dl>

## parallelCompute :chart_with_upwards_trend:
**Contains all of the scripts related to parallel compute.**
<dl>
<dt>parallelsForLoop.R</dt>
<dd>An R script that creates a FOR loop, and iterates over the FOR loop using both parallel and non-parallel compute.</dd>

<dt>parallelsMatrix.R</dt>
<dd>An R script that creates a linear mixed-effects model and analyzes the data in both parallel and non-parallel compute.</dd>

<dt>parallelsWhileLoop.R</dt>
<dd>An R script that creates a FOR loop, and iterates over the FOR loop using both parallel and non-parallel compute.</dd>
</dl>

## AWS :palm_tree:
**Contains all of information relating to R and AWS.**
<dl>
<dt>S3</dt>
<dd>A walkthrough for connecting your R session to an AWS S3 bucket.</dd>
